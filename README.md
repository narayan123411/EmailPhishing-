# EmailPhishingDetection

**Project Overview:** This academic project focuses on the detection of phishing emails using advanced machine learning techniques. With the rise of email-based cyberattacks, detecting phishing emails has become crucial for maintaining cybersecurity. The project aims to build a model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and phishing emails by analyzing email features and patterns.

**Key Features:**

_Data Preprocessing:_ The dataset includes various email attributes such as subject lines, email content, sender information, and metadata. Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words have been applied.

_Feature Extraction:_ Using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings to transform textual data into meaningful features for the model.

_Model Development:_ Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression are implemented to detect phishing emails. The models are evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

_Training and Validation:_ The dataset is split into training and validation sets to assess the performance of the models and avoid overfitting.

_Final Model:_ A well-optimized model is selected based on performance metrics to provide robust phishing email detection.

**Project Goals:**

1. Identification of phishing emails.
2. Improve email security by accurately flagging suspicious emails.
3. Analyze and extract critical features that indicate phishing attempts.
4. Future scope includes developing a system for VIP.

**Technologies Used:**

Python: For model development and data preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): To handle and analyze email text data.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data distributions and model performance.
